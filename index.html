    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="about-content">
        <p>
            Hello! I’m <strong>Junyi Wu</strong>, a graduate student passionate about 
            <strong>business analysis, data science, and strategic problem-solving</strong>. 
            Originally from <strong>Liaoning, China</strong>, I’ve spent the last five years in Canada, 
            where I completed my <strong>Bachelor of Commerce in Finance</strong> at the 
            <strong>University of Alberta</strong> and am currently pursuing a 
            <strong>Master of Information Studies at McGill University</strong>, specializing in 
            <strong>Data Science and Business Analytics</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            My journey has been driven by a desire to uncover insights from data to inform 
            smarter business decisions. I’ve gained hands-on experience through roles such as:
        </p>

        <ul class="experience-list">
            <li>
                <strong>Finance Intern</strong> at <strong>China Everbright Bank</strong> – Analyzed financial data and delivered actionable insights to senior management.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Project Intern</strong> at <strong>BMW Brilliance Automobile</strong> – Contributed to vehicle design improvements by analyzing customer feedback and design benchmarks.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>AI Intern</strong> at the <strong>National Supercomputing Center</strong> – Optimized machine learning models and created data visualizations to support decision-making.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            I am skilled in <strong>Python, SQL, Excel, Power BI</strong>, and 
            <strong>data visualization tools</strong>, with experience in 
            <strong>machine learning</strong> and <strong>data mining</strong>. My goal is to bridge the 
            gap between data and business strategy, helping organizations achieve their objectives 
            through data-driven insights.
        </p>

        <p>
            In my free time, I enjoy <strong>photography, hiking</strong>, and exploring new technologies, 
            always seeking new ways to learn and grow.
        </p>

        <p>
            I’m excited about opportunities where I can apply my skills and passion to make an impact 
            as a <strong>Business Analyst</strong>.
